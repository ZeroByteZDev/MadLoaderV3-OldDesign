# MadLoaderV3-OldDesign
This is the earliest design of MadLoader (Now Known as MadUI) Version 3.

We had multiple different frameworks projects Used on these project, these frameworks used are .NET Winforms, .NET WPF and the Final and the current one is C++ Qt.

So I decide to share the Winform version here cus im deleting it to my PC.
